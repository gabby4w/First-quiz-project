# First-quiz-project
Hello everyone, I'm excited to show my first quiz project. It's a quiz about some fun facts of Toronto and I'm welcoming all inputs and suggestions. I'm currently 3 weeks into coding so please free to give me advice to improve this code. Thanks!
My goal here was to make a little game where the user has a certain amount of lives. Pretty much just answer the questions and if you lose all 5 lives it's game over.
